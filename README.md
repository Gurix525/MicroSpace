# MicroSpace

A simulation of an astronaut community in the orbit. A strategy game with a micromanagement.

Currently we can give orders to build and destroy blocks. We can also freely steer the ships (according to orbital mechanics).

Austronauts have an original system of pathfinding and moving in a fully dynamic environment.
